#    This is an open source Text RPG Game called PowerText.
#    It was thought up by Lucca Cioffi.
#    It was fine tuned by Elizabeth Cone.
#	 You can use this for any kind of python game
#	 so long as you include both authors names, the
#	 name of the game (PowerText), and a
#	 link to the github page for others to use
#	 it in the Read Me. Leave a comment on the github page if you'd
#	 like us to check out the game you make,
#	 we would love to see what you've thought of!
