# This is a Python Text RPG called PowerText.

## It was written by Lucca Cioffi at Topsy Studios.

> You can use this for any kind of python game so long as you include both authors names, the name of the game (PowerText), and a link to the github page for others to use it in the Read Me of your own project. Leave a comment on the github page if you'd like us to check out the game you make, we would love to see what you've thought of!

### Ultimate Goal:
> The ultimate goal of PowerText is to have a functioning system of navigation, quests, upgrades, combat, and storytelling for future text RPG creators to modify and use.

> Own its own, the game will have a unique story, rememberable characters, and should be fun for those playing.
